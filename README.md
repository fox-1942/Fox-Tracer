This is an OpenGL based, real-time ray tracer for visualizing 3D polygon meshes loaded from OBJ files.

Used technologies :
- C++
- GLEW, GLFW libraries
- Assimp library for loading OBJ files
- Shader storage buffers
- BVH-tree
- MÃ¶ller-Trumbore ray-triangle intersection algorithm

The performance was optimized with bounding volume hierachies (BVH-tree), meaning that the bounding boxes are divided along the longest axis. The longest axis
is always placed on the average centroid of the polygons. The whole tree is stored in a plain array and sent to a shader storage buffer in the fragment shader.
This way the traversal is taken place in the fragment shader and the contstruction is on the CPU side.

The application is capable of visualizing:
- Total reflection
- Diffuse light
- Phong-Blinn shading
- Ambient Light
- Textures

Required libraries:
- Assimp 5.0.1
- GLFW 3.3.2
- GLEW 2.1.0
- Cmake 3.17
